A secure, simple yet customizable passphrase generator (in Rust). Use provided dictionaries or bring your own!

## Built-in dictionaries

Some dictionaries are built-in, to make passphrase generation easy.
They are hidden behind rust features, in order to keep the crate size small.

List of built-in dictionaries:

| Dictionary           | Rust Feature to enable |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Eff Short Wordlist 2 | `eff_short_2`          |
| Eff Short Wordlist 1 | `eff_short_1`          |
| Eff Large Wordlist   | `eff_large`            |

### Add new built-in dictionary

A small program to generate dictionaries is provided.

1. Provide a list of words in a file, one word per line.
2. Run `cargo run --example create_dictionary_from_file -- --help` to get started.
